Dynamic webpage that fetches quotes from an external API provided by [Jacinto Wong](https://github.com/JacintoDesign). It displays a random quote along with its author, and offers the option to generate a new quote or share the current one on Twitter. The page shows a loading animation while fetching quotes and employs responsive design to handle varying quote lengths.

Interactive webpage is built to display a grid of random images fetched from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers). As the user scrolls down the page, more images are loaded dynamically. A loader is displayed during the initial loading phase, and once images are loaded, they are presented in a responsive grid layout.

It also offers a button to activate the Picture-in-Picture mode for the video, allowing the captured screen content to be displayed in a smaller, draggable window while continuing to use other applications.
